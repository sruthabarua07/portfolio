    <b><p>Hello there! My name is Srutha Barua, a 12th grader at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. Here some things to get to know me. Growing up, I had this energetic personality which made people impressed and mostly shocked in many ways. In addition, I am a huge anime fan, primarly watching Jujutsu Kaisen and Dragon Ball. I am also into gaming, AI, and a bit of finance. Majoring in finance
    would be the right choice to study in.</p></b>
    <p>Here below, you can find numerous projects I have committed to. </p>
